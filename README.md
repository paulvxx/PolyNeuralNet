## Polynomial Neural Networks

Polynomial Neural Networks (or PNNs) are a Neural network whose output (can be assumed to be logits) is high-order polynomial function of the input. PNNs are of special research interest for a few reasons, namely rich expressitivity, algebraic analysis, and homomorphic compatibility.
