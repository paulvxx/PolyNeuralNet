# PolyNeuralNet

## High Level Description

This repository focuses on training Polynomial Neural Networks (or PNNs) in multiple contexts and models (i.e. ResNet, Transformer, ...), which are Neural Networks whose output (can be assumed to be logits) is a high-order polynomial function of the input. PNNs are of special research interest for a few reasons, namely rich expressitivity, algebraic analysis, and homomorphic compatibility.
